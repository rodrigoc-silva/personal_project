# APP_GROUP_2

## App Ideas

* Geek'nMeet 
    The user can put the geek stuff they like,
    for example, movies, anime, code ... and the app
    shows users who like it.
    
* Petgram (terrible name!)
    An instagram just for user's pets. 
    With photos, videos...
    
* Raffle
    the user can sell things, where he divides the value of the product into quotas and one of the people who bought a quota is drawn and takes the product for a very low price, while the others who did not win, did not lose much.
